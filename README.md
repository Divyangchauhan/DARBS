# Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (LARBS)


## Installation:

On an Arch based distribution as root, run the following:

```
sh larbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is DARBS?

DARBS is edited version of LARBS from Luke Smith. LARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning
and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linux environment.

LARBS provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more
customization.
